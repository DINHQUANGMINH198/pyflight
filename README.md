pyflight

Pyflight is a simple flight simulator, written in Python. Graphics are implemented
with PyOpenGL, and user input / windowing uses Freeglut. 

Pyflight has been tested on Linux Mint Debian 3.11.8. I'm working to test  / make
it compatible with other systems, but for now, Linux is the only supported OS.

To run pyflight:

git clone
